# What is LibreMind?
**LibreMind** is a visionary project founded by Aaryan Kumar Tiwari. The name itself reflects its essence: "libre," meaning "free" in multiple languages, and "mind," emphasizing both freedom and intelligence. This ambitious endeavor aims to encompass various projects, with the ultimate goal of expanding into a business. I envisions creating both nonprofit software and profit-oriented ventures under the LibreMind umbrella.
